# App Usage

> **Configuration Value**: Notes like this will show where there is a value that needs to be
> recorded for setup of the phone app. 

## Before starting

The app must first be installed, see [App installation](../app-install/README.md).

If you plan on using a remote database, that also must be set up, see 
[Remote logging](../remote-logging/README.md).

## Physical set up

### Target

The app is designed to periodically report distance measurements between the phone and a 'target'.

This target acts as a simple [fiducial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiducial_marker) to be 
placed in the phone camera's field of view.

The target should be a solid square on a high contrast background, for example a solid black square
printed on a white piece of paper.

What's important is that there is a high contrast between the target and the background, and that 
the target is square. A4 paper makes a good background as the paper itself is not square so will
not be mistaken for the target.

A sample target is provided in a PDF [here](sample-target.pdf), it is made so that the target
is 0.15m square when printed on A4 paper (Although be sure to measure it to be sure). 

> **Configuration Value**: Record the side length of the target to use when setting up the phone
>app.

### Placement

Mount the phone and target securely on either side of the area being measured.

The phone's camera must be able to see the target, and you will still need to access the phone's
touch screen for configuration.

> **Configuration Value**: Record the initial distance between the phone camera and the target to
>use when setting up the phone app.
