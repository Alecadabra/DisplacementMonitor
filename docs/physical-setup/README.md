# Physical setup

This details the physical set up of the measurement environment.

Before starting this, ensure the app is installed on the phone, see
[App Installation](../app-install/README.md), and the remote logging system is setup (If being 
used), see [Remote Logging](../remote-logging/README.md).

## Target *(Off-site)*

The app is designed to periodically report measurements of the distance between the phone and a
'target'.

This target acts as a simple [fiducial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiducial_marker) marker to be 
placed in the phone camera's field of view.

The target should be a solid square on a high contrast background, for example a solid black square
printed on a white piece of paper.

What's important is that there is a high contrast between the target and the background, and that 
the target is square. A4 paper makes a good background as the paper itself is not square so will
not be mistaken for the target.

A sample target is provided in a PDF [here](sample-target.pdf), it is made so that the target
is 0.15m square when printed on A4 paper (Although be sure to measure it to be sure). 

> **📝 Configuration Value**: Record the side length of the target.

## Placement *(On-site)*

Mount the phone and target securely on either side of the area being measured.

The phone's camera must be able to see the target, and you will still need to access the phone's
touch screen for configuration.

> **📝 Configuration Value**: Record the initial distance between the phone camera and the target.
