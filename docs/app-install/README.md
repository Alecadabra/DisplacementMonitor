# App installation *(Off-site)*

This goes through the process of putting the app onto the phone.

## Compatibility

The app is compatible with Android phones.

The phone must have a camera and use Android 4.1 ('Jelly Bean', Released 2012) or higher.
The phone's Android version is generally located under Settings > About.

The phone will need internet access for this installation.

## Allow installation

You first need to opt-in to allowing the app to be downloaded as it is not coming from the
first-party Google Play Store.

If your device is running Android 8 ('Oreo', Released 2017) or above, navigate to 
'Install unknown apps' in Settings (Most settings apps have a search bar to aid in finding this).
Select the web browser you will use to download the app and allow app installs from it.

Otherwise, if your device is running Android 7.1 ('Nougat', Released 2016) or below, navigate to
'Unknown Sources' in Settings > Security and switch the setting on.

## Download & Install

The app is packaged into an APK (Android application package) located in the
[Releases Page](../../../../releases).

Navigate here on the phone and download directly. Once the APK is downloaded, use the web browser's 
open/view option, or the download notification to open it. You will be prompted to confirm that you
want to install the app. You may get a popup saying 'Blocked by Play Protect', just press install
anyway. Then, the app should be installed.
