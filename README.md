# Displacement Monitor

A displacement measurement and monitoring Android app.

This app is made to be set up to monitor the displacement (distance) across an area, where the
phone is placed on one side, and a visual target is placed on the other side. The app periodically
measures the distance between the phone and the target, and can be set up to send these measurements
to a remote database and dashboard.
